# Planner

This is a vanilla project to push and prod a canvas element.

## What is it?

The aim is to produce a really simple app for laying out model railway track onto a board to get a feel of how lengths, radii, and potential operations, feel - and hopefully save a few trees on the way.

## Oh no, not another!

Yes.  There are plenty of popular packages already out there - both free and paid-for - and they're *really* packed with features this project won't even begin to challenge.

This app won't have any convenience features, keystroke shortcuts or mouse-click magic.  Nor will it prevent numpty configs - if track is connected so it overlap, the app will be working if it records this accurately.

## Feature list

By the end we should have a *very* simple app with the following features:

- drag new track from a list of predefined types onto the canvas
- drop track onto existing track and have it connect
- move track on the canvas to a new position
- remove track from the canvas
- rotate track currently on the canvas
- reorientate track on the canvas, eg curved track turning to the left should be flippable to the right.
- save/load the current layout.
- undo/redo the above actions

I'm sure there'll be more - but the above should keep things from meandering.
